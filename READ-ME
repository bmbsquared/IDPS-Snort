Using resources listed and through more research I would like to create an IDPS that detects, alerts, 
and blocks specific files as well as blocks access from certain websites on the internet. 
I will use the SEED Ubnuntu VM to emulate a computer being connected to a network that has such security measures in place. 

Software Utilized
Oracale VM SEED Unbuntu
Snort Open Source IDPS
